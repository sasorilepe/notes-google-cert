  <p>viewport <b>not</b> set</p>
  <p>This page does <b>NOT</b> have the meta viewport set.</p>
  <p>This is a test to show how the meta viewport tag affects a page. To simplify this example as much as possible, font boosting has been disabled.</p>
  <p>Adding the attribute initial-scale=1 instructs browsers to establish a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels regardless of device orientation, and allows the page to take advantage of the full landscape width.</p>
